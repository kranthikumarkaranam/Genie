Developed a full-featured E-Commerce app 📱 using React Native for both Android and iOS. The app features product listings 📋, add-to-cart 🛒, and checkout 💳 functionality, along with user authentication 🔒 and an intuitive product search 🔎. It ensures persistent cart storage 🛑 so items remain saved after closing the app. Utilized Redux for application-wide state management, maintaining consistent product states throughout.
